SSXcodeSnippets
===============

The main objective of this application is to download customized snippets from your account in Dropbox into XCode Snippets folder.
Sure, there are other apps out there using github instead of dropbox which are very cool. But I think I may use my own app to work with snippets. 
You are free to use and change code (probably it will need to be changed and improved xD)

HOW DOES IT WORK
===============
1. Create a folder in your root Dropbox account called: Snippets
2. Open this application
3. Press "Login button"
4. A new window page will be prompted in your web browser
5. Login with your dropbox account 
6. Allow access to the application
7. The application will download all snippets immediately when you login, but if you were already logged, press "Download Snippets"

BUGS:
===============



TO DO:
===============
- Release for production (is only for development right now)
- UPLOAD to Dropbox (when Dropbox release the option ;] )
- Separate classes. Taking out classes from appDelegate ¬¬ 
- Logo 
- Hide api client (oops)
