SSXcodeSnippets
===============

This is NOT a complete project YET. 

The main objective of this application is to upload and download customized snippets to your account in Dropbox.
Sure, there are other apps out there using github instead of dropbox wich are very cool. But I think I may use my own app to work with snippets. 
You are free to use and change code (probably it will need to be changed xD)


TO DO:

- Separate classes. Taking out classes from appDelegate ¬¬ 
- Logo 
- Hide api client (oops)
